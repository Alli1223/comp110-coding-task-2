This is the repository for COMP110 Coding Task 2.
Please fork it and check in your code and other material as detailed in the assignment brief.


For this assignment I am going to design the environment AI for our comp150 game.
This will include the way fire and oxygen behave in the game.

I am planning on designing the fire like a cellular automaton that passes from cell to cell and expands if there is oxygen in the room and depletes if there is a lack of oxygen. 

For the oxygen I plan on designing it like a fluid, so the oxygen will flow around the level, from cell to cell like a liquid. The player can then reduce the oxygen in a room and move it to another room.
