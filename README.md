# comp110-coding-task-2

##The game component I am going to create:

I am going attempt to design the environment AI for our comp150 game.
This will include:

+ The way in which fire will transverse the rooms and cells in the game. 
+ How oxygen will behave.

###Fire
I am planning on designing the fire like a cellular automaton that passes from cell to cell and expands if there is oxygen in the room and depletes if there is a lack of oxygen. 

###Oxygen

For the oxygen I plan on designing it like a fluid, so the oxygen will flow around the level, from cell to cell like a liquid. The player can then reduce the oxygen in a room and move it to another room.
